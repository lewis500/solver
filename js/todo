speed up calculations



get rid of window resize watches?

put the throttle on the drag itself

redo the bar der
connect the two charts

REFACTOR
speed up the dataservice


screw the whole watching the element thing. just do a window resize event


remake the templates

have the axes functions watch the range/domain


disconnect the main plot thing



histogram


plot os and ds
make a button for solve
make inputs for vb, vs


get ticks working

clean up what you did with the dots
pass the scales and height and such through the service
get ride of all the vm. stuff. too much of a good thing! 

use $scope to pass services into directives that contain a bunch of stuff, not vm.... (maybe?)
